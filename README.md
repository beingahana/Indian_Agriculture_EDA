# Indian Agriculture Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

Welcome to the **Indian Agriculture EDA Project**, a comprehensive analysis of agricultural trends in India. This project explores production, yield, and other key agricultural insights across different states and time periods, highlighting India's agricultural landscape.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

### **Data Source**
The data for this project has been sourced from trusted public datasets (from `Kaggle`). The dataset covers agricultural metrics like production, yield, and crop-specific data across various states of India.

### **Data Cleaning**
Data cleaning and preprocessing steps included:
- Handling missing values by either filling them contextually or dropping rows/columns.
- Removing duplicates and ensuring uniformity in state names and crop classifications.

### **Data Visualization**
The visualizations were created using **Plotly Express** and **Plotly Graph Objects**, which enabled the development of interactive and insightful charts. These visualizations provide a clear understanding of key agricultural trends across states and time periods.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview
This analysis dives into India's agricultural statistics and answers the following questions:

### **Key Questions Answered**
1. Which states have the highest agricultural production values?
2. How does production vary across states for different crops?
3. What are the yield trends for key crops over the years?
4. How do production and yield metrics correlate with each other?
5. Which states contribute the most to India's food production?
6. How do different states compare in terms of crop diversification?

### **Major Insights**
- **Top Producing States:** States like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and West Bengal lead in agricultural production.
- **Crop-Specific Insights:** Insights were generated for specific crops (e.g., rice, wheat, sugarcane) to highlight regional specialties and trends.
- **Year-wise Trends:** Analyzed year-on-year production changes to understand the impact of climatic conditions and government policies.
- **Interactive Visuals:** Included bubble charts, bar graphs, and line plots to explore state-wise and crop-wise data effectively.

---

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations
The project uses a variety of visualizations to present data interactively:

- **Bubble Charts:** To visualize production by state and category.
- **Bar Charts:** For state-wise crop comparisons.
- **Line Plots:** To show trends in yield and production over time.
